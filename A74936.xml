         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Highneſs the Lord Protector, having with much prudence ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weighed the Debates and Tranſactions of the Parliament; and after mature deliberation and conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119019:3"/>with his Honourable Councel, upon the vaſt expence of time, and the few things done therein, reſolved to put a period to their preſent ſitting; and accordingly on Munday, about ten of the clock in the forenoon, his Highneſſe came in his Barge from VVhite-Hall to VVeſtminſter, being accompanied by divers of his Lords and Gent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; where, coming into the Painted Chamber, the Parliament were ſent for; and upon their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Highneſſe. He delivered himſelf by way of ſpeech as followeth;</p>
            <p>That he could not but take notice of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of their Debates; and of their prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time to little purpoſe; That he was ſorry to behold ſuch a Spirit of Averſe eſſe, that in ſo many moneths nothing could be eſtabliſhed and confirmed for the good of this Church and State, and the peace and tranquility of the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of England Scotland, and Ireland; whoſe welfare and preſervation, He deſired to prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all particular Intereſts whatſoever; That he did proteſt in the preſence of Almighty GOD, (laying his hand upon his Breaſt) he never did ſeek his own Honour but deſired rather, that the publique Affairs of the Common-wealth might
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119019:3"/>be ſo ballanced in the Skales of Equity and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that all things might conduce to the glory of God, and the Peoples Comfort; And as touching his deſire in the leaſt to have his Sonne Henry (or his Poſterity) Hereditary, he proteſted againſt it; aſſuring them, He was very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in their voting of the power and Authority of Lord Protectors for the future to be Elective; as knowing it to be the onely Baſis of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, He exhorted them to peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity uſing many Scripture phraſes; and interwove his ſpeech with many admirable and ſingular Texts; declaring the Grounds and Reaſons of his diſſolving that preſent Seſſion; which done, He took his leave, and retiring forth, each Member departed, and the Mace was taken, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment door ſhut up.</p>
            <p>This ſudden change cauſeth no little admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a Declaration will be publiſhed to give the People ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>THe parliament having ſpent much time upon the Articles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and having run through the ſeveral Chapters thereof, inſiſted upon the BILL for ſetting the Government, which being ingroſſed, was reported to the Houſe, and read; at which time many proviſoes were offered to be added thereunto as part thereof, whereof this was one, That it be provided, that this Act for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do not extend nor be conſtrued to extend to abrogate, alter, or diminiſh, any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119019:4"/>the Charters, Cuſtoms, Liberties, or Franchiſes of the City of London, or any other Cities, Towns, or Burroughs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Common-Wealth, ſaving in ſuch things, whereby any alteration is thereby particularly made; but that the ſaid City of London, and the aforeſaid places, ſhal and may enjoy their ſaid Charters, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Liberties, notwithſtanding the ſaid Act, or any thing therein contained: After which another proviſo was offered to be added to the BIL for ſetling of the Government; and particularly one about the Militia, which was to this effect, That the Militia ſhould not be raiſed or form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by conſent of parliament, and to be uſed for the preſervation of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and not otherwiſe.</p>
